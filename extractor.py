This program separates the odd and even numbers into categorized text files.

1. Look for numbers.txt file
2. Iterate through every number from numbers.txt
    - If even, store it on even.txt
    - If odd, store it on odd.txt
3. Remember to close the txt file! (Use with operator for a foolproof execution!)
